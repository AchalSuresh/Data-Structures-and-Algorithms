# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structure are used to organize data in an organized way that enables efficient access and modification

Commonly known data structures are Array ,Linked List etc

* Arrays: Collection of element with position identified through index. Random access Fashion since each element can be directly accessed. 

* Linked List: Linear collection of elements called Node. Each node has reference to the next node in the list

The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk


### Algorithms:

* Recursion: Recusive functions is a function that calls itself while running.

* Sorting Data: It is a method of arranging data in a ascending or descending order. The common sorting algorithms are
1.  Bubble Sort:It is the Simplest sorting algorithm however takes the longest time [O(n2)]. it moves across the list comparing each element with its successor and making switch.
1. Merge Sort: ALso Known as divide and conquer algorithm. Splits the data into smaller sets and sorts each of the them. It utilizes recursive function for its implementation. It has time complexity of O(nlogn)
1. Quick Sort: Similar log
